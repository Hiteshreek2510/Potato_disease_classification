# Potato Disease Classification Model
This project is a Deep Learning-based Potato Disease Classification model designed to classify various potato plant diseases using images.
The backend of this application is powered by Django, while the model itself leverages advanced machine learning techniques to classify the disease type based on plant images.

## Overview
The aim of this project is to automate the detection of potato diseases using deep learning models trained on a dataset of potato plant images.
The classification model is integrated into a Django web application, which allows users to upload images of potato plants, get disease predictions, and receive recommendations for treatment.

This system helps farmers and agricultural professionals diagnose diseases quickly and accurately, ultimately improving crop yield and reducing the impact of diseases.

## Features
#### Image Upload: Upload images of potato plants to the web application for disease classification.
#### Disease Detection: Predicts the disease based on the uploaded image using a trained deep learning model.
#### Disease Classification: Categorizes diseases such as Late Blight, Early Blight.
#### Model Feedback: Provides a confidence level for the predicted disease.
#### User Interface: A simple, responsive UI for users to interact with the classification model.

## Technologies Used
#### Django: A powerful Python web framework for building the web application and backend.
#### TensorFlow/Keras: Libraries for building and training the deep learning classification model.
#### Python: Main programming language for backend logic and model training.
#### HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap: For frontend interface to allow users to upload images.
#### SQLite: For database management.
